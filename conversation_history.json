        "content": "Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) are both database services offered by AWS, but they have some key differences:\n\n1. Database Engine:\n   - RDS supports multiple database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB.\n   - Aurora is a proprietary database engine developed by AWS, compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.\n\n2. Performance:\n   - Aurora is designed to offer significantly better performance than standard MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, with up to 5x performance of MySQL and 3x of PostgreSQL.\n   - RDS provides standard performance for the respective database engines.\n\n3. Scalability:\n   - Aurora offers better scalability with automatic storage scaling up to 128TB.\n   - RDS has manual storage scaling with limits varying by engine (e.g., 65TB for MySQL).\n\n4. Replication:\n   - Aurora provides built-in replication with up to 15 read replicas.\n   - RDS supports read replicas, but the number varies by engine (e.g., 5 for MySQL).\n\n5. Fault Tolerance:\n   - Aurora offers better fault tolerance with automatic multi-AZ replication.\n   - RDS offers multi-AZ deployment as an option.\n\n6. Backup and Recovery:\n   - Aurora provides faster backup and recovery times.\n   "
